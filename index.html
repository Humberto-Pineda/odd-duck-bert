        <p>Stuff! Everybody wants stuff! Even ducks want stuff! If there isn't any stuff, then there is no stuff!
          And having stuff is better than having no stuff.
          <br><br>
          Think of stuffed crust pizza. Do you think stuffed crust
          pizza is better stuffed, or not stuffed? Or a Thanksgiving turkey? What would the stuffing be without stuff?
          <br><br>
          So it's very clear that ducks want stuff just like people do. Consider this stuff only the beginning of
          all the stuff that will be stuffing the pockets of all the ducks that buy this stuff!
          <br><br>
          You can order our stuff online! (Coming Soon)
